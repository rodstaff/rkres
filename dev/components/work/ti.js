        <ul>
          <li>Designed prototype analog power management devices using computer aided design (CAD), from concept-to-engineering-to-manufacture contributing to the generation of $600,000 in new sales.</li>
          <li>Initiated and coordinated troubleshooting activities and failure root cause analysis with the testing, wafer fabrication and customer engineers providing optimum and novel solutions delivering products at market premium prices.</li>
          <li>Generated specifications for assigned projects forwarding them to the sales and marketing departments for bidding processes compiling summary reports detailing configuration and “trade-off” studies for “best/worst case” recommendations interacting with senior management.</li>
          <li>Introduced and encouraged the initial use of software modeling of motor driver key components moving from an otherwise error-prone trial-and-error method in analog board design.</li>
          <li>Software Tools:  Pascal (Test/Debugging), SPICE (Circuit Simulation), Silicon Graphics (Layout Generator).</li>
